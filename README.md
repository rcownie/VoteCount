# This repository contains GPL'ed code for aggregating and transforming
# precinct-level election results (usually starting from one-file-per-county)
# into a more standardized one-file-per-state CSV format as required for
# the precinct-level analysis published at http://votesleuth.org
#
# The input data for each state is obtained from the open-elections project
