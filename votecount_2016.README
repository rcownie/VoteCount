Introduction
------------

votecount is a flexible program for transforming tables of low-level detailed
election results (usually with precinct-level vote counts) into a single
higher-level table (e.g. a table for a state, with one line per precinct).

Since the format of results varies from state to state, and from county to county
within a state, votecount is controlled by a table which specifies the rules
for transformation and aggregation of the low-level results.  This contains
both global rules (e.g. to recognize variations of the candidate-name which
occur across different states), and other rules to be applied to particular
states or state.county inputs.

Rule specifications
-------------------

We provide a sample rule table "votecount_2016.conf" with rules for the
2016 presidential general election.

The rule table is in CSV format using comma as the field-separator.

Here is a simple rule table (formatted with comments and extra spaces for clarity,
though these are not allowed in the actual file):

State, County, Action            MatchCase,  MapFrom,           MapTo

ANY,   ANY,    MapColumnName,    NO,        "Office",          "Race"
ANY,   ANY,    MapColumnName,    NO,        "Candidate Name",  "Candidate"
